ORATIO m Μ. ANTONIUM. 295

sed totam fabulam confecissem. Quanquam si inter-
{sei Caesarem‘voluisse crimen est, vide quaese, Anto‘-
ni, quid ‘tibi futurum sit; quem et ³Narbone ⁴hoc
consilium cum C. Trebonio cepisse notissimum est, et
ob ejus consilii societatem cum interficeretur Caesar,
tum* te a Trebonio vidimus ‘sevocarh Ego autem
(vide quem, tecum agam non inimice) quod bene
cogitasti aliquandO, laud03 quod non indicasti, gra-
tias ag03 quod non fecisti, ignosco: virum res illa
quaerebat. Quod si te in judicium quis addffcat,
usurpe'tque illud Cassianum, CUI BONO F UE-
RIT, vid’e, quaes0, ne haereas t quanquam illud qui-

3. Narbone—‘Illis was one of the most ancient cities of Gaul, and
gave its name to the province in which it was situated. ‚

4. Hoc consilium, eta—When th'e conspirators were consulting· a·
bout killing· Caesar, it was debated among them, whether they
should invite Antony to assist them ; but Trebonius was opposed to

flue motion, pretending, that he knew Antony3s sentimenta relative

to this matter, as he had already endeavoured to urge Antony to it,
at that time when Caesar was returning from Gaul. He represent-
ed at the same time, that Antony refused to comply with what he
proposed, but that he had nevertheless kept the secret faithfully.
They then debated whether they should kin Antony together with
Caesam but Brutus opposed thie, because he thought, that whatever
was undertaken in defence of liberty and the laws of one’s country
ought, if possible, to be conducted in a popular manner. Thus
much Plutarch relates3 Cicero, however, affirma), that Antony en-
tered into the design against Caesar, but that he had not courage to
assint in the execution of it. 7
5. Sevocari—When the conspiratura determined on the manner,
in which Caesar should be elain, ,they ordered Trebonius to call
Antony aside, in sear that Antony, who was then consul, and Cae-
3²²⁵? colleague, should exert his consular power to frustrate their
emgn. ‘’
