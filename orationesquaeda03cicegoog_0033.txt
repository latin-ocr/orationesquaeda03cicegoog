INTR 01) U ΟΤΙ ΟΜ

WHEN Cicero had finished his spirited ech in the Seme,
Cutiline still continuedto practioe the most p ound dissimulationg
hepretended to be enm-ely imment ofthe erinneu‚ofwhichhevu
scanned-3 md, with downcan looks and in a supplicat mannen, re·
quested the senators not to credit what his enemy had said against
him. He said, that such was his family, and euch had been tho
whole tenor οἱ his life, that he was, encouraged to hope for ev
⁸ honour,to which he could &spire z and that it eouldnotbemppooiz
that he, a Patrician, whose ancestors, aa well as himself, had given
many. proofs of their affection to the Roman people, should with to
overturn the government; andthat Cicero, astrmger, of an obscur.
’ family, a. ‹n‘tizmof Arpinum, a tenant only of a house ianne which
he had lately hired, should be ao zealously active forits preservationi.

But 2⁸ his languagb began to be. abusive. he, wagintermpted by the

senatore, who in ageneral exclamation, called him &Pan-scida and

mEnenm to laia cnuntry. Enraged by this treatment, he repeated in a

lond and. menacing tone of voice what he had* said before to,Cato;

“Since Lam circumvented, and driven headlong· by my enemies, the

flame, that is raised, about me 1 will extinguish bv a general min?

Perceiving· that it was impossible to disssemble any longer, he dc·

termined to enter into action immediately, before the troops of ¹ the

Republick were increased or prepared to meet him. He therefore
left Rome that very night, and went towards Etr-urim but before he
departed from the city, he had an interview with Lentulue, Cethe·
gns, and others, the boldest of the conspiratura, in which he urged
themto neglect no means of increaping· their number,to put Cicero
to death„ as. soon as„ possible, and to prepare for a massacre and the
conflagrationi of the city; and he gave them assurances, that he
would soon return at the head of- a strong· army. When he had left
the city, his friends reported, that he had gone into a voluntary exile
at Mammea„ (ἰάσατο, however, knew. that he was going· to Man·
lim’ camp, as he was certain that he had· already sent thither πως,
military (τηθὶς-ηε, and particularly, a silver engle, for which he had
a superstitious reg-ard, because Caius Marius had used, it in his ex·
pedition ‘nst the Cimbri. But that the report might not be be·.
lievaed, 'm city, and that-it might not be said, that the Consul had
driven an innocent man into banishment without previous trial, Cic«
ero the nen day membled the people in the Forum to give them
an account of what had. been done in the Senate the day preceding,
and of Catiline’s sudden departure from Rome in consequence of ἰῇ,
which was the design of the following oration.
