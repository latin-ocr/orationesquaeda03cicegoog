ORATIO IV. IN L. CATILINAM,

INTR 01> U CTION.

THE Senate, the next day after that in which the Consul had
communicated the detection of the conspirator-s, ordered publiek re-
wards to be given to the deputies of the Gauls and to Vultur-cius,
for their discoveries; but in the mean time the city being· alanned
by reports ,of new plots, formed by the slaves and partisans of laen·
tulus and Cethegus for their rescue, Cicero resolved to terminate
the affair as soon as possible, and therefore on the day succeeding·
summoned the Senate to determine the question concerning the
punishment, which should be inflicted Ι upon the prisoner-s. The
opinion of Silanus, the consul elect,- was first givenz he thought

the estates of the criminals should be confiscated,thottheir persons
should be closely confined in the strong-est of the municipal towns,
and that. it should be unlawful for any one hereafter to move the
Senate or People in their favour. His elegant and eloquent speech
made a 'great impression upon his auditam it is said, even Silanus
altered his opinion, and that the friends of Cicero, solicitous for
his safety, which, they thought, would be secured by mild meas-
ures, readily concurred in Caesar’s advice. Cicero, however, per-
eeivin the opinions of the Senators to be changing, rose and de·

had the semblance of neutrality, strongly supported the coonsel of
