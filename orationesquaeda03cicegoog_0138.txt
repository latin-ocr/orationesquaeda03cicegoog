1. Diuum& oilentii-—In a letter to Servius Sulpicius, Proconsul in i
Greece, Cicero, mentioning· the petitien for Macella& return, writes,
“ What the senate did was this ; upon the mention of Marcellus
by Piso, his brother Caius-having· thrown himself at Caesar's feet,
they all rose up, and went in a supplicating manner towards Caesar: 1
in short thia day’s work appeared so decent, that 1 could not help ¹
fancying I saw the image of the old republick revivin . When all, 1
therefore, who were asked their opinions before me, ad returned
thanks to Caesar, excepting VolcatiuS, (for he declax-ed, that he
would not have done it, though he had been in the place of Marcel·
lue) 1, as soon as 1 was called upon, changed my mind ς for 1 had
resolved with myself to h ave observed an eternal silence, not through
any lazinesS, but the loss of my former dig-nity ς but Caesar's great—-
neas of mind and the laudable zeal of the Senate ovet-came reso-
lution. 1· gave thanks, therefore, to Caesar, in a long epeec , and
haye deprived myself by it, iscar, on other occasionS, of that honest
quiet, which was my onl comfort in these unhappy times ς but
since 1 haye hitherto avoided giving· him offence, (and, if 1 had al·
ways commued silent, he would have interpreted it perhaps aa a
proof of my believing the republick to be ruined) 1 shall speak for
the future not osten, or rather very seldom ς so as to manage at the
same time both his favour and myown heisure for study.”

2. Ba qud egosm‘eoem—-Marcellus and ‚Cicero were of the Pom-
peian party ς after the battle os Pharsalia, Cicero accepted pardon
of the conqueror ,ς the high spirit of Marcellus and the ancient
eloi-y ofhis house would not permit him to receive any farours from
a master. He retired to Mitylenae.
