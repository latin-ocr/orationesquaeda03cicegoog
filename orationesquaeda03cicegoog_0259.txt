1. Ademit-Clodius enacted a law against Ptolemy, king of Cy· ¹

prus, to deprive him of his kingdom, and reduce it to a Roman
province, and confiscate his whole estate. This prince was brother
· to the king· of Egypt, and reigned b'y the same right of hereditary
succession ς was in peace and amity with Rome, accused of no
practices, nor suspected of any designs against the republick. But
Clodius was inimical to him, because he refused to ransom him,
when he was taken prisoner by the pirates, and sent him only the
small sum of two talenta. To sanction this iniquitous law, and give
it the better face and colour of justice, Cato was charged with the
execution of it, which gave Clodius a double pleasure, by imposing ,
such a task on the gravest man in Rome.

2. Aedem nympharum—A temple was erected in Rome to the “’

nymphs presidin g over fountains, that they might be propitious in
preventing fires ς which tempssasvas burnt by Clodius.

3. Ut-memoriam exungueret—Every five years the Censors used
to take an account of the several tribes, and to make up a register,
in which the crimes of all the citizens were marked ; and as Clo-
dius knew, that his enormous crimes were recorded in the publick
acts, he burned the temple, in which they were kept, that the re-
membrance of his wicked deeds might be lost. ·

4. Cn. Pompeium—This was not Pompey the Great, for he was

not one of the jud es of this trial. In several editions the name of
Q. Varius is place instead of Cn. Pompeius. ·
