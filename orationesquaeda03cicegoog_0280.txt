276 ORATIO m M. ANT‘omtm.

possit Antonius. An in Senatu facillime de me ‘de0 ’
trahi posse credidit? 'qui ordo clarissimis civibus

Bambalio lost his causeae-Thejm praetorium was apower assumed.
by the Praetoris, of mending, supplying, andcorrecting the civil law,
as necessity and equity should. require.
