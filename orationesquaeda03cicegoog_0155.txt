ORATIO PRO Q. LIGARIO.

INTR OD U CT] ΟΜ '

THIS oration, which is said to have made Caesar tiemble, was
pronounced a short time after the oration for Marcessus vas deliv-
ered, and was similar to that in its subject. Thesacts, which occa·
sioned it, are as follow: Before there was an appearance of a civil
war, Quintus Ligarius went into Africa in the capacity of Heutenant
to the Proconsul Caius Considius. So satisfactory was his conduct
in this station, that when Considius departed from the province, he
determined to gratify the inclinations of the people, and confide its
government in the hands of Ligarius. Ligarius, after long and un-
availing refusal, unwilling-ly received it, and resigned it with pleas-
nre, when Attius Varus carne to take possession ofit. In the mean
time the war between Caesar aud Pompey commenced ς and Lu·
cius Tubero, with his son Quintus, was sent by the Senate into Af-
rica to obtain provisions. Although Ligarius and Varus were of
Pompey's party, as well as Tubero, theywould not receive him, nor
suffer him to put his sick son on shore. Being driven to Macedo·
nia, 'Hibero then joined Pompey, and there took arms againstCaesarz
but, having seen his party ruined at thebattle of Pharsalia, he aban-
doned his unsuccessful General, united himself to Caesar, and fol-
lowed the conqueror to the Alexandn'ne and African wars. After-
wards when the war was concluded, and when Caesar had forgiven

interceded for his pardon. Caesar was much offendet! with Liga-
riuS, and wished to reject the petition ς but when he saw cicere,
Pansa, Brocchus, and others join in the request made for his par-
don, he began to be inclined to« grant it. At -this time Quintus Tu·-
bero, son of LuciuS, influenced bx motives of revenge for-not having
been iomerly received into Africa, and being therefore desirous to
obstruet an favour, intended to bebestowed upon Ligarius, that.
⁸ he might effectually gratify his vindictive desire-5, brought forward
anaccusation against Ligarius, charging him with having prose-⁴
cuted the warin Africa against Caesar with uncommom zcal and.
violence. Caesar, wh'o was greatly exasperated against those, who
through aversion to him had renewed the Ali-ioan war, was pleased.
by the accusation, and, being greatly prejudiced against the de-
fendant, changed his former determination, and became resolved ει)
sacrifice him to the gratificatiorr of hisvown revenge. Plutarch re-
lates, that Caesar was so much prepossessed‘againstLigurine, that,
when the trial came on, and he was told that Cicero intended to'
fflead for him, he said, be saw no reason· wh'y he should attend to

m, as it was evident that Ligarius was an enemv, and therefore
erimina. He however permihtteil the orator to spe'ak'.
