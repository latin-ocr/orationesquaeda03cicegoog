ORATIO m M. Aureum. 275

QUON AM meo ¹fato, Ρ. C. fieri dicam, ut nemo
his ²annis viginti reipublicae hostis fuerit, qui non.
bellum eodem tempore mihi quoque indixe‘rit ἓ N ec
vero nece‘sse est a me quenquam nominari vobis, cum

⁴ ipsi recordamini: mihi poenarum illi plue„ quam op-

tarem, dederunt. Te miror, Anto'ni, quorum facta
imitere, eorum· ³exitus non perhorrescere. Atque
hoc in ⁴aliis, minsis mirabar t nemo illorum inimicus
mihi suit voluntarius z omnes a me reipublicae causzi
lacessiti ; tu, ne verbo quidem violatae, ut audacior· .
quam L. Catilina, furiosior quam P. Clodius viderere,
ultro maledictis me lacessisti; tuamque a me alien-
ationem commendationem tibi ad cives impios fore
putavisti. Quid putem? contemptum-ne me ? non
video nec in vitii, n'ec in ‘gratifu necin rebus gestie,
nec in hac mea mediocritate ingenii, quid despicere

1. Fato—The ancients defined sate to be the connection and se-
ries of au causeS, by means of which all thing-s hamma, that do hap-
1³25·stan vigsmae--Twenty years elapsed between the Consulship
‚of Cicero and the Consulship of Antony. ·

3. Exime non perhorrescere—Catilium who conspired against the
republick and against Cicero, was elain in battle, bearing· arms
against his country. His accomplices in that conspiracy were, by
a decree of the Senate, killed in Ἴ rison. ClodiuS, who was an inq
veterate enemy to Cicero, and w ο by his inu-ignes drove him into
exne, was siaiu by Milo, · ς
· 4. mie—He here means Clodius, Catiline, VatiniuS, Piso, and
Gabinius, 331 opposing whose vices Cicero v'sas more active in attack-
ing than in defending. . “

5· Gracia-The Romans consen-ed distin shed marks of favour
on Cicero. When he was banished by eloffiiis, almost the whole
equestrian order changed their gai-ments ς twenty thousand of the
yotmgmen of the greatest eminence in the city, accompanied those,
who were to intercede for his restitutiom and afull Senate decreed
a change os dreSS, as in a general mourning. When he was onthin
return from exile, the Senate and people went out to meet him ς
they conducted him in triumph, as it were, and with the greatest
ehouts from the Porta Capena to the Capitol.
