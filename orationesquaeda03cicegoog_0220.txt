9. Negant—The Clodiane asserted, that Milo deserved death fin·
having killed a man. This assei-tion Cicero refmes by auargkument

1. M. Horatii-In the 8:3rd year of Rome, when Tullus Hostilius
was king, there was awar between the Romans and Albans. After
some success on ‚both sides, and when the two armies were near

. each other, the Alban General discovered, that some of the neigh-

bearing· natione vere waiting for nn engagement, which t
weaken both the Romans and Albane, and that they were determin-
ed to improve the opportunity of endeavouring to conque-1· each of
them„ Aster fiiis discovery he became desirous of ente ⁶ into
alliance with Hostilius, the king of Rome, but the parties co d not
agree upon the tel-ms. while they were thus situated, the Alban
Genera] proposed, that the dispute should be settled by combat,
and that three champions should be chosen fqm each camp. The
proposal was accepted. Three brothers in each were select·
ed, the Albans were named Curiatii, the Romans oratii. Soon
aster the battle commenoed, two 'of 'the Horatii were alain, but the
third Horatius, exerting all his strength, slew the three Curiatii, and
=thus gained {br his country an honouxable victory. It happened,
that the sister of Horatius was en ed in1marriage to one os the

oung Albane, whom h‘er brother a slain. W’hen therefore her

rother returned from the field, she *reproached him for h ‘
slain the man, whom he knew his sister loved, and exclaim ,
‘³ Thou monster os visk-educes, how couldoae thou clip tlzy hands in the
blood os thy relations !” Horatium still warm with slaughter, and en·
rag-ed at these reproaches and the untimely grief of his sister, said,
‘⁶ Go then to thy lover, with thy unseaoonabte passion, thou, who firgu-
test thy dead brothers, thy liw’ng brother, and thy country. TrmS, let
every Roman per-ish, who lamento the deathqs an enemy to Boua-'⁹
As he uttered these last words„ he stabbed her with lus sword, and
without longer stay,without sig-n of pity or remorso, went straighton
toltisfather’shouse. His father approved of cruel deed τ and when
Horatius was tried for the murder of his sister, he was acquitted by

the Peme,
