1. Quirites—The Senators of Rome were at first addressed with
the title of Patres, which appellation was 'given them by Romulus
'on account of their age and dignity'3 those persons, who were cho-
sen into the Senate by Lucius Junius Brutus, after the expulsion of
‚Tarquin the Proud, were called Con-scripti, that is, enrolled together
with the Senator-83 but afterwards the name Patres conscripti was
usually applied to all the Senator8.-—The word Quirite& was the ap-
pellation by which the people were addressed: lt was at first pecu-
liar to the SabineS, but when Romulus had united the Sabines to
the RomanS, it became the general name of the inhabitants of Rome.
' 2. Abiit, excessit, evas-it, erupit—These words are not tautologic-

' ah abiit implies only the action of going , excessit signifies he, indu-

ced by some influential motive, has departed from us; evasit indi-
cates that he has escaped from daug-en erupit declares that, anx-
ious for his safety and the execution ofhis designs, he fied with pre.
cipitancy from a place, where the latter was almost impossible, the
former very precarious.

“ 3. Sica illa—The dag-ger mentioned in the former oration.

4. Non in campo. .......... qro....curic3.....domesticos parietes—Bekre
Catiline departed, Cicero, as his life had been so often attacked,
'thought it imprudent to go into the Campus Martius unarmed ς
when Catiline was concerned in the proceedings of courts of justice,
he prevented the dictates of law and equity from being observed, by
his menaces and arms 3 as he had often intended to murder the Sen-
ators‚ it was unsafe for that body of men to take their “ scats in the
Senate-house ς and before his departure‘ it was hazardous even to
sleep in private houseS, thatwere not fortificd.
