4 ORATIO 1. IN L. CATILINAM.

sirous than he ever had been of obtaining the consulship, in order
that he might more effecmally exeeute his intention of subverting·
the republiok. He practieed themost profound dissimulation} b his
addi-ess and bribes obtained an acquittal of the many crimes ofw ich
he was accused ς and made two attempta to be elected consul. But he
did not succeed. At the latest election Cicero and Antonius, two

of his competitore, were chosen. This continual ill success made '

Catiline at last ⁶desperate ς he immediately prepared to execute his
bloody intentione. By all the arta of allurement he possessed, he
courted and corrupted the young nobility ς with the most consum·
mate address he attached· to himself the most factione, profligate,
and abandoned charactera in the city; and by various artifices he
ingratiated himself into the affectione of the most indigent class of
citizenS, who were ever ready to follow a leader, that promised
them great rewards. With his accomplices he held frequent
meetingS. In one of these, held at the house of Marcus Lecc‘a, it
was determined, that an insurrection should be immediately raised
through all Italv3 that Catiline should take command of the army,
which Manlius had collected in Etruria, and bring· it to take posses-
sion of “Rome3 that Cassius should infiame the city in several places ς
that, during the confusion created by the conflagration, 'Cethegus
should murder the senate ς that Lentulus, being first in rank, should
conduct their counciIS‚ and that two Roman Knights, who were
then in the assembly‚ should the next morning in his bed assassinate
Cicero, from whom they expected the greatest op osition. Butthe
mectin was no sooner over, than Cicero was in ormed of all its
procee ings. Fulvia, the mistress of Curius, one of the conspirat,
ὁ tora, had persuaded him to send the. consul an account of all their
transactions. Cicero guarded his house against the Kni hts, who

 

came in the morning· to execute the commission assigned em ς and γ.

the next day he summoned the senate to assemble in the temple ef
Jupiter Stator in the Capitol, where they seldom convened exceptin
times of public danger. The desi s of Catiline had lon been sus-
pected3 great rewards had been o ered to him, who wo d discover
them. This' artfu‘l hypocrite, however, so successfully dissembled
his intentions, that he persuaded many to believe him innocent, and
he constantly asserted,that the suspicions, so prejudicial to his char-
acter, arose from the defamatory tales of Cicero, his professed ene-
my. He even offered to put himself into the custody of whomever
the Senate would appoint3 but no person would consent to be hia
guard. Catiline nevertheless continued to practise the arts of hy-
pocrisy, and indeed had the impudent confidence to come to this
meeting· of the Senate, which was expressly called to receive infor·
mationtof the discovery of his daug-emus conspiracy. The Senators
were astonished to see him take his seat among· them as usual, and
so abhorred the crimes of which he was accused, that they instantly
, vacated the benches near which he sat ; and Cicero was so enraged
by his impudence and audacity, that he did not, as was common,
begin business in a methodical manner, but immediately addressed
him in the abrupt snd severe invective, that follows.
