He had. an inu-igue with Caenet’s wife, Pom ia, who, according· to
uumal euntem, was now celebrating in her ouse those awful and
mystick sacrifices, to which no mele creature was· ever admitted,
end whereaetory thing· masculine Νη oo scrupulously excluded,
that even picturesof that sort were covered during· the ceremony.
This was a proper scene for Clodiu& genius to aet upon, an oppeto
