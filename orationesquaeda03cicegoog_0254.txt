5. Vicum, etc.--According· to Van-0, there· were three kinds of
streets in the city of Rome ς the vici, the smndulae, and the ang-ipor-
ti ‚· the vici were the chief streete, open at both ends ; the fundulae
‘ were open at one end and closed at the other, like what are called
coum in populous cities: the angiporti, were lanes or alleJS, so nar-
row that they admitted only people to walk in them, waggons and
carriages of all kinds being· too large to enter them.

6. Ocriculanam-„This was a city of Umbria towards Etruria, near
the Tiber‚ in which Milo had a house.

7. Molleolorum-Malleoli were small bundles of broom covered
with pitch; which, being kindled, were thrown on the walls or
roofs of houses.

8. Popa--Thiswas a term of reproach among· the Romans-«The
popa was priest, or bu'tcher‚ who slew the sacrificet-2, and offered

thern up, when slain. His duty was also to purify the house& in
which any one had died.
