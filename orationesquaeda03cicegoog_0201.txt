5. Census—A census, or enumeration of the people was usually
taken once every five years. The census did not make or prove a
man to be a citizen ς but was only presumptive evidence, that he
'had been admitted to the sreedom of the city. Gracchus said, that
the name of Archias was not upon the Censors’ books; Cicero re-
plies, that Archias was absent with Lucullus, when the census wau
taken, and that when he was in Rome, the census was not taken.

6. Proximis censoribus—In the time of the last Censors‚ Archiae·
'was with Lucullus at that time General in Asia ς in the time of the
preceding Censor, he was with the same Lucullus, who was then
Quaestor in Asia3 when Julius and Crassus were Censorii, no census
vas ¹{akenf The census about that time was discontinued for a
num er o vearS. '

7. uve iinus judicio—Gracchus pretended, that by Amhias’ own
confession he was not a Roman citizen.

8. Testamentum jecit—Strangers could neither make a will, nor
nocive a legacy'3 Archias, therefore, by making a will and receiving
legemem declax-ed himself a citizen. .

9. Ad aerarium-It was customary, vchen a soldierhad behaved

‘ lemarkably yell, that the Genera] should commend him to the treas-

ury to receive ‚a reward3 these recommendationi) wexe thought
very honourahle. R2 .
