2. Repuaeiiari—In a note up'on this passage, Merouille says, Caesar
was desimus of Cicaeo advised it, and Pompey rejected
it. It may be a act that Caesar desired peace, but he desired only,
· the peace of slavery, the nonresistance of tame submission to his

imperious mandarem and, although the gesna-al emdmuf Pompe„
demonstrated, that he was neither a great politiam, nor an able
General, yet with manly inens-natica he reje peace, as a repub-
lican should have done, upon such base condi ons.

3. Prudens et sciens ad interitum wlmari icero in this sen-⁹
tence assigno for the whole reason-of his joining Ponpey what wa·
only one ofhis inducements. He really thought that Caesar was an
memy to his country, and that the δαΐαις of the republick would
be coexistent with Pompey's success. He therefore from political
principle united himself to the Pompeian party. But he here tello
&esst-,that he sided with Pompey from Μ not meh mot-iven,
bound by ties of gratitude for the personal favours he had received
stom hm, and that cool andconscious of his danger, he lnnged
into, as it were, voluntary destruction. This apology mi t 'have

, been successful ς but it is to‘be reg-retted‚ that talents so great, as
those of Cicero confessedly wem, should be employed in a nervice·
m dishonorable, as that os flattery and dissimulation.

4. Cum capitis mei petimIo—-The fbllowing· comment has been
made upon these worda—‚Cicerowas not present. at the battle of,
Pharsaha, nor was Cato, who staid behind· also in the camp at Dyr-
rachium, which he commanded with fifteen colim-ts, when Labienus
brought them thenews of Pompey’s defeat ς upon which ento of-
fered the command to Cicero, as the superior in dignity; and upon
hin refusal of it, as Plutarch tells us, oung Pompey was so enraged,
that he drew his sword, and would ave killed him upon the s t,
if Cato hd not prevented it. Though this fact is not mentioneffiy
