ORATIO IN M. ANTONBUM 303

sua erga me beneficia commemorat: ’ejus omnium
incendiorum ,faxz cujus etiam domi ³quiddam jam
tum molitus est: quid dicam, ipse optime intelligit.
Inde itur Alexandriam ⁴contra Senatus auctoritatem,
eontra religionem: sed habgbat ducem Gabinium,
quicum quidvis rectissime facere posset. Qui tum
:inde 'reditus, aut qualis? prius in ultimam Galliam
ex Aegypte, quam domum x quae autem erat domus?

§uam enim quisque domum tum obtinebat, neque erat

usquam tua: domum dieo? quid erat in terris, uhi
,in tuo pedem poneres, praeter unum Misenum, quod
num sociis'tanquam ‘Sisaponem tenebas?

XX. Venisti e Gallia ad quaesturam petendam.
Aude dicere„ te prius ad parentem tuam venisse,
quam ad me3 ''acceperani enim jam ante Caesaris
literas, ut mihi satisfieri p'at‘e'rer a te: itaque ne lo-

2. Ejus incendiorum saxa-‘me profligacy of Antony's eharacter
justified this assertiom

3. Quiddam—-Antony endeavoured to commit adultery with Ful-
via, elodiae-wife, whom, &ter the death of Clodius, ‘he married.

4. Contra Senam auctoritatem—Ptolemy, King of Egypt, being

expelled by the Alexandrines, applied to the Romans for restoration
tto· his throne. Gabinius, persuaded by Antony, undertook to rein-

’ state him, contrary to the authority of the Senate, and to the Sibyl-

liglxeboracleffi which forbade that an Egyptian king should be replac-
³e an arm .

&XRecktmffprim in ultimam....quam domam—From Egypt, whith-
er Antony had gone with Gabinius, he went to Caesar in farther
Gaul ς his numerous debts prevented his going-to Rome. As Cice-
ro asset-ts, Antony had no house, except one at Misenus, a part of
which was in possession of his creditors. ·

6. Sisapmmn—§isapo was a town of Corduba, in Spain, famous
for its mines of red lead. lt is here applied reproaehfully to Anto·
ny’s possession of his farm at Misenus ς for Sisapo was beldin com-
mon, not by any one in particular.

7. acceperam Caesaris literas—One of Antony’s objecta in going· to
Caesar in Spain was to procure money enough to secure an elee-
tion to the Quaestorship; but, fearing, that he should not succeed,
if Cicero was opposed to him, on account os'his intimacy with Clo-
doips, he prevailed upon Caesar to write conciliatory letters to the

ator.
