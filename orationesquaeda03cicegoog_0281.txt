· QRATIO IN M. ANTONmM. 277

⁸infi‘mo ordini commendares3 cum omnes te'recor-
darentur libertini generum, et liberos tuos nepotes Q.
Fadii‚ libet-fini hominis, fuisse. At enim te 3’ἱιι dis·-
ciplinam meam tradideras ; (na'm ita dixisti) domum
meam ventitaras3 nae tu, si id fecisses, melius fa-

miae, melius pudicitiae tuae consuluisses ε sed nec

fecisti, nec, si cuperes, tibi id per ⁴0. Curionem fa-
cere licuisset. ⁵Auguratus petitionem mihi te con-
cessisse dixisti. Ο incredibilem audaciam Ξ ὀ impu·

'dentiam praedicandam! Quo enim tempore me au-

gurem a toto collegio expetitum Cn. Pompeius et Q.
Hortensius nominavErunt‚ (neque enim licebat a plu-

· ribus nominari) nec t‘u solvendo erem, nec te ullo mo-

do, nisi eversa· republica, incoliimem fore putabas·

2. Infima ordini—The plebeian order.

3. Jn disciplinam meam—It was customary, when young men took
the manly gown, to place them under the tuition of some eminent
citizen, that they might be instructed in useful knowledge and 'the

*duties of life, and be formed to virtue and humanity.

.. 4. 0. Curionem—Curio was a youngnobleman of brilliant talentsz
admirably fitted by nature to adorn the character (in which his fath-
er and grandfather 'had fiourished before him) of one of the princi-
pal oratore of Rome‘, bnt a natural propensity to pleasure, stimu-
lated by the example and counsels of his perpetual comparum, An-
tony, hurried him into all the extravagance of expence and de-
bauchery. When ’his father, by Cicero’s advice, obliged him to
quit the familiarity of Antony, he reformed his conduct, and adher-
ing to the instructions and maxims of Cicero, became the favourite .
of the city, the leader of the young nobility, anda warm assertor of
the authority os the Senate, against the power of the T1·iumviri.-.-
After his fath'er's death, upon his first participation of publick hon·
oure, and admission into the Senate, his ambitionrand desire of pop-
ularity engaged him in so great prodi guilty, that, to supply the mag-
nificence of the shows-and play-S, with which ‚he entertained the
city, he was soon driven to the necessity of selling· himself to Caesar,
and fell the first victim in the civil war.

5. Augur-atus, eta—It was necessary, that a candidate for admis-
sion into the college of augum, should be nominated by two au-
g‘urS, who gave a solemn testimony upon oath of his dignity and
fitness for tli'e office ; this was done in Cicero’s case by‘· Pompey and
HortensiuS, the two most eminent members os the college.
