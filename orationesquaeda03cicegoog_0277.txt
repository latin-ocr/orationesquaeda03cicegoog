¹ ORATIO IN M. ANTONIUM,

INTR οι) σρτιοανῑ

APTER the assassination of Julius Caesar by Brutus and css·
sius, there were many parties aud tumults in Rome. The conspir-
ators, having no design beyond the death of the despot, were un-
decided respe cting· the measures they should take, and neglected
to pursue those means, which were necessary to reestablish thelih-
erties of the republick. Max-k Antony, who, during the last year
of Caesar’s life, was his eolleague in the Consulship, at first imagin-
ιιὰ himself in dan er, and began to fortify his house ; but observing
the indecision andgpaeifiek conduct offlie authors of Caesar's death,
herecovered his spiritS, and resolved to usurp the government, as
soon as he was able, and, upon pretence, of avenging· the murder of
his colleague, to destroy all, who should oppose him. To executc
this design, he pretended to have no other desire, than to see the
republiek settled upon its old basis. He assumed the appearance

> of goodness and moderation ς talked of nothing, but conciliating

measures ; and, for· a proof of his sincerity, moved, that the ’con-

xcepted {Brutus supped wgith LepiduS, Caslius with Antony 3 the
day was closed with joy and rejoicing, and the city thought, that
liberty would be secured with peace. On pretence ofpublick con-

cord, however, Antony proposed and carried several things, of ‘
which he afterwards made a very pernicious use; particularly a de· q

eree for a confirmation of ‘all Caesar's acts. The people soon saW,
for what end he had provided this deorse, to which the Senate con-
sented for the sake of peace. Antony, being master of Caesar’s
papers, and of his secretary FaberiuS‚ by whose hand they were
written, forged and inserted at pleasure whatever he thought would
be of use to him, and publickly sold for money whatever immuni-
ties were desired by countrieS, ciues, princes, or private men, pre·
‘tending- that they had been granted by Caesar, and inserted in his
books. These and several other instances of his duplicity and vio-
lence convinced the conspirators, that no good was to be expected
from him, dr a Senate, which was under his influence.
About this time Cicer0, who had hitherto maintained some de-
ree of neutrality or moderation between the parties, being alai-med
y these violenceS, departed from Rome. He had,-befoe·e the death

· of Caesar, intended to withdraw into· Greece, tuider pretence of su-
, perintending the education of his son at Athens, and had obtained
Caesar's consent and the leave os the Senate for that purpose. On ,

Caesar’s death, having hopes, that the republick was about to re,-

vive, he took his resolution to remain in the city ς but being· now

satisfied, that these hopes were vain, he resumed his former desiign

of absenting himself ; and instead of applying to the Senate ' ὸι·

leave, accepted f‘rom Dolabella, the newly appointed Governor of

‘Syr-ia, a commission of neutenaney‚whieh he was to employ as a prc-
