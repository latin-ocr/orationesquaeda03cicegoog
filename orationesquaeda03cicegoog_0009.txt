² ORATIO 1. IN L. CATIL ΝΛΜ.

ΙΝῪΗ ΟΒ Ue* ‘1⁸1 OJV’.

⁸ m the six hundred and eighty seventh ear of Rome, lasciuo
Ser ' s Catiline, a man of patrncian rank an great abilities, but of
awicked andambitious disposition, formed a conspiracy to elevate
himself and his accomplices to power and wealth upon the ruins of
his coun . From his earliest youth, he was fond of civil wara, of
rapine, an of massacres. There was no crime however atrocium,
which he was not willing to commit; there was no vice however in·
famous, of which he was not inclined to be ' y. He debauched
a young lady of illustrious family, afterwa seduced a Vestal, and
is said to have violated the chastity of his own daughter. To grat·
ify Sylla, whose partisan he was, he assassinated a brother. He
even murder-ed a son, because Aurelia Orestilla, whom he wished
to marry, disliked to have a full grown son in law. Indeed he ιο
often committed murder and other heinous crimes, that he did not
seem to think the commission of them criminal. But at length, not
coutented with the commission of many private vices, he conceived
the design of a conspiracy, which, had nt been executed, would have
been unparalleled in the annals of history. After his return from
Africa, the province assigned „to him upon the expiration of his
Praetorship‚ he sued for the Consulship ς but, in consequence of an
accusation of extortion and mal-administrationi, which the African
cities preferred against him in Rome, he was not permitted to asser-t
and maintain his pretensions to that office. It was du ⁶ the pen·
dency of this trial, that, it is supposed, he first thought 0 destroy-

thority, which he could not obtain by election. He entered into a
combination with AutroniuS, Cneius Piso, and others, to put the
consuls to death and seize the consulship. Their design, at the
first attempt to execute it, was frustrated by the absence of Crassus,
31ιὰ bqy Julius Caesar's not giving the signal agreed upon, and they
ere
od. At the time appointed, they had enlarged their plan, and de·
termiued not only to kill the consuls, but also to murder the Senate.
But by too great precipitancy the conspirators again defeated their
own designa. Catiline, however, did not remit his exertionsz he
seems to have been calculated to make the most hazardous at-
tempta with the greatest discouragements. He was now more de-
