fence Dr. Middleton, Cicero’s English historiari and panegyrist,
makes against the charges offlsttery ancl selfish motives, as that au-
thor offers no other proof of his disinterestedness,than his own de-

pretensions to sincerity. He sayS, “ Cleero’s real sentimenta and o-
pinions cannotbe proved by any particular passages in these letters. . ,

more sincere.” We would mention the authority also of Hook, the
Roman laistei-ian, who is more severe upon Cicero than,any author
we have quoted, did we not believe he traduced the characters of
-most of the great men of Rome 'to elevate that of Julius Caesar.
. But more quotations are unnecessary. We have been induced to
select those already expressed, not from any desire to detract praise
from Cicero's character, of which we still have a high opinion, but
from a wish to prevent the youth, who shall study these orations,
from forming, by their perusa] esthan, erroneous ideas of the chat»
muers of distinguished Roman citizens. We therefore will not hes·
itate to declare our opinion, that in this oration Cicero extols the
„px-aises of Pompey too mgb, and that he depreciates the merit of
Lucullus too much. For the first opinion we have the authorit of
Cicero himself,xwho in a future period of his life confessed, he ad
, nounced praises on Pompe ‚which he did not deserve ε and for the
st, we havethe authority οὲ Plutarch, ,who says Lucullus possess·
je? ἓτὲξιι qualities, courage, vigilance, activity, prudence, and the
ve o justice. . “ .
