genius and character of this poet, we cannot help reg-retting the en-
tire loss <ff his works; he had sung in Greek verse the trimphs of
Marius over the Cimbri, and of Lucullus over Mithridates, and was
now attempting the Consulship of Cicero ς but this pel-iahed with the
rest, or rather was lest unfimshed and inter-rupted by his death,
since we find no further mention of it inCicero’s laterwritings. At
the time of delivering this oration, Cicero was in the fortyessixtrh

year ofhisage. , . ⁷ ·
