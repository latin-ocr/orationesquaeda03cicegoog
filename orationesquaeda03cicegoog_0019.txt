the providential discovery of catiline’s conspiracy, was lately deliv-
ered from ruin equally imminent; and Cicero, no less grateful for
his remarkable deliverance than Tarquini, gave great thanks to the
immol-tal Gods, and with great propriety to this Jupiter Stator in

⁸ ‚ the most ancient protector of the city, who had deliver-
ed it from early destruction, and had so lately preserved it from
conflagratum, and prevented the assassination of its Senate and
eitizem. ·

tempta to raise himself to sovereign power.

5. camuli designato-During the interval between the election of
Consule and their entrance into office, which was generally six
months, the persons chosen were called Consule elect. Cicero and
Catiline the last year had been rival candidateS, and as Cicero suc-
needed not only in being elected to the consulship himself, but
also in excluding Catiline, this assassin had determined to attempt
to murder him in the Campus Martius. The vigilance of cicere,
however, defeated his design. The next ear, while Cicero wan
consul, at the time the Comitia were held, ie again employed his in-
fluence in preventing the election of Catiline, who stood candidate
foi-‚the consulship this year also, and Catiline again endeavoured to
kin him in the field ofelection. But the pmdence of Cicero and
the exertiona of his friends again prevented the execution of his
mxu-demus mtentions.
