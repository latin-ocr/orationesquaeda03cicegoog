6. mnumerabiles—lt is said that Caesar co uered four hundred
different people in Gau15 but these nations pro ably were but petty
triber„ like those of the savages of this country.

7. Simillimum deoj1edico—-Cieero has been accused of flattery and
insincerity in this oration, as well as in that upon the Manilian law.

ed‚’' says Dr. Middleton, ‘⁶ that he was delivering a speech ot'thanks,
not only for himself, but in the name and at the est of thesto-

atory; and that all his eompliments are grounded on a suppositsom
that Caesar intended to restore the republiok; of which he enter-
tained no small hopes at this time, as he signifies in a letter to one
of Caesar’s principal friends, This therefore he remanentis, en-
forces, and requires from him in his speech3with the spirit of m
old Romam and no reasonable man 'ivill think it strange, that· eo
free an address to aeonqueror, in the heig t of all his power, should

want to be temper-ed with some few strok s of flattu-3⁷3⁹ Of this
defenee every one will form his own opinion.
