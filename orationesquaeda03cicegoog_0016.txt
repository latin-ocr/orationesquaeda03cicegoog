10 ORATIO 1. IN L. CATILINAM·-

ne, me ante diem ⁵XI1. Kalend. Novemb. dicere

in senatu, certo die fore in armiS, qui dies futu·- ’
rus esset ante diem VI. Kal. NovembriS, C.‘
Manlium audaciae satellitem at'que administrum tuae?
num me fefellit, Catilina, non modo res tanta, tam
atrox, tam incredibilis, verum id, quod multo magis
est admirandum, dies? Dixi ego idem in Senatu, cae-
dem te optimatum contulisse in ante diem V. Kal.

non tam sui «conservandi, quam tuorum ⁶consiliorum
reprimendorum eausa, profugerunt. Num inficiari

potuisse, cum tu, discessu caeterorum, nostra tamen,

shewn to Cicero. , .

7. Praeneste—Catiline had designed to take the town of Praeneste,
which was within twenty five miles ‹listance from Rome, and was
one os the strong-est fortresses in Italy. It would have been ofgneat
use to him in the war, and would have afforded him a safe retreat
is he should be defeated. Cicero, however, apprehending that he
would make this attempt, put the town in a state of defence, and
when Catiline came on the night of the first of November to make
an smack, he found it so well gum-ded, that he was obliged to ‘a-
bandon his desig-n.
