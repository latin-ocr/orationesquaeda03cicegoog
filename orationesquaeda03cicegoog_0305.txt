ORATIO m M. ANTOMUM. 301

praetextatum ⁴'’te decoxisse? patris, inquies, ista culpa
est: conc‘e’do: at enim est 'pietatis plena defensio,
*Illud tamen audaciae tuae, quod sedisti in quatuor-
defflim ordinibus, cum esset ‘lege Roscii decoctoribus

'cerem locus constitutus, quamvis quis fortunae vitio,

non suo decoxisset. Sumpsisti xssifilem, quam statim

fmusielzrem togam reddidisti: prim& vulgare scor-
tum ι certa fiagitii merces, nec ea parva: sed cito
Curio intervenit, qui te emerem-icio quaestu abduxit ς
ιτ, tanquam stolam dedisset, in matrimonio εῐᾙέᾗί et
nerto locavit. ¹Nemo unquam puer emptus libidiinis
causa tam fuit in domini potestate, quem tu in Curi-
»onis ε quoties te pater ejus domo sua ejecit? quoties

’ custodes posuit, ne limen intrares? cum tamen tu,

nocte socii, hortante libidine, cogente mercede, per
&gissan demitterere ε quae flag-itia domus lua diutins
ferre ndu potuit. Scis-ne me de rebu's mihi ιιοῐίεειί-ι
mis dicere ? {cordate tempus illud, cum pater Curio
moerens jacebat in lect03 filius, ee ad pedes meos
prosternens,lacrymans, te ,mihi commendabam orabat,'

in which it is here used, is filial duty.

6. Lege Bocchi—The Roscian law decl-ced, that those Kni· hta,
whose estates were correspondent to their dignity, should ava
benches provided for them in the theatre, from which all Knights

women. Asterwards the modest women were distinguished by
the palla and the ειοῖας the former was their ordinary vest, worn
within (soors, coming down to their ancles; the latter they put on
when they went. abroad, and covered with it the stola and their whole
body. The common courtesans were not allowed to wear the stola,
but were obliged to appear in a gown, as a mark of infamy, on ac-
count of its resemblance to the habit of the opposite sex.
