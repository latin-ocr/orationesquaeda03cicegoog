had alledged, that unusual grants o '. exorbitant power were the
eauaesefan the miseries‚the republiok had suffened from the pro-
scriptions of Marius and Sylla, and that they were pernicious and
contrary to the constitution of Rome, he told the people they were
too fond of Pompey, and asked them, “,Should you unfortunately
lose him, in whom would you place your confidence θ’ “In you,
CA'ruLosss’ they an cried out with one voice. Gamlus was of con·
sular rank, and popular.
· 3. Hortensius-Hortensius began ve early to make a figure st
the bsx-3 he was only nineteen years o age, when he pleaded hio
first c‘ause with great eloquence and excellence. “ Like a statue of
Phidias,” says Cicero, “ the instant he was seen, the same instant
he was admired.’' He charmed the eye no less by his action, thau
the ear by the harmony of his voice and the musick of his periods.
‘⁵ He reigned absolute in the Forum,” says Dr. Mitldleton5 “ when
Cicero first entered it, and as his superior fame was th‘e chief spur
of Cicero’s industry‚ so the shining specimen, which Cicero soon
gave of himself, made Hortensius likewise brighter for it, by oblig-
mg him to exert all the force of his genius to maintain his ground
against his young· rival. They passed a great part of their hves in
a kind of equal contest and emulatiou ς but Hortensius, by the su·
periority of his years, having first passed through the usual grada-
tion of publick honours, ancl satisfied his ambition by attaining the
big-hest, began to relax somewhat of his old centenum, and gave
way to the charms of ease and luxury, to which bis nature strongly
inclined him, till he was forced, at last, by the general voice of the
city to yield the post of honour to Cicero?
