ἸἩῙΒ celebrated oration, the first which cicero deliveri· , ¹

'ed from the Rostra, was pronounced in the six himdred and
eighty-seventh year of Rome, in the forty·first year of the Oe-
eator's age, and three years before the {orations against Cat-ilinc.
The Romans at that time were en aged in war with Mithridates,
‘King of Pontus, *rhis monarch, a le, mubitious, wan-like, and a
,second Hannibal in military talento, as well as in hatred to the Ro-
mans, disdained to submit to the commands of the Roman com·

unfortunate incidents enabled Mithridates to become master of the

Tribunos, proposed a law, that Pompey, who was then in Cilicia
heiminasing· the piratick war, should have the government of Asia
addedtohis commission, with the command of the Mithridatick war,
andos all the Roman armies Ain those parts. This law was much
opposed by the Senate, who were unwilling to confer so extensive
'nithority upon any indi-vidual, but was so popular with the people‚
of whom Pompey was a goeat favoni-ite, that none except Catulus
and Hortensius, who had both passed through the Consulship, dar-
ed to speak against it. lt was defended by Servilius Isauricus and
Caesar ς Cicero also, at that time Praetor, most eloquently advoca
