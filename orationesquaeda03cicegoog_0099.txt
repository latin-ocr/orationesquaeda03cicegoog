k 9. Cn. Pompeii {livino consilio-This seems to apsimach more to

flattery than to truth. lt is a well kno‘wn fact, that by the good sor·-
me only of Pompey, not by his divino consilto ac fivtgtdari virtute,
the army of Sertorius was dispersed. The dispersum of his forces
was the consequence of his death, and he was slain, not by means
of the military talents of Pompey, which he easily baffled, but by
the infamous conspiracy of his pretended friends, Perpenna and An-
toniuS, who basely assassinaoed him at an entertainment, to which
they had invited him. Cicero, it has been supposed, was induced
by venai motives to extol Pompeyin this oration ; the defence, which
he makes, will be considered at the close of it. ·
