‚ORATIO PRO· REGE· mmmm

*—

IMRODUcTIam· . ›

oF the facts relative to this oraison we can learn but little from
historians; even the character of Deiotarus seems not to be ascel-
tained with aecuraoy; belis represented by some aa* mathie and ξ
vii-tuens, by others, aa san uinary and cruel. An incident, which
has perhaps prevented the acts concerning· the subject ofthis dra·
tion from being mere fully and correctly known, ia, thatit wasnnt
delivered in the Forum, but privately before Caesar in a dwelling
house. What we have been able to leam is, that king· Deiota-us
was Teu-arch of Gauograecia--that during· die civil wars between
Caesar and Pompey he assisted·the latter-“that after the b'attle of
Pharsalia he abandoned his party-«that, after having· been stdpped
of part of his dominicus, to atone for his offence, he was pardoned
by Caesar—that during the >wara in the east he entertained onem
as his guest in the castle df Lucceius—and that, after the civil eon·
tentions had been for some time composed, he was accused before
Caesar by Philippus, his physiciatn andalave, of having· intended to
assassinate Caesar, while he was his guest ; of having for this
purpose placed assassins in a room, into which he invited Caesar to
enter and view some presents he had prepared for him, and also in
a bath, in which he expected Caesar would bathe before he retired
to bed ; of having ever been an enemy to Caeam-3 of having· levied
an army against him3 of having· designed to send messengers to
CaeliuS, a man professedly inimica] to Caesar3 υἷέ* sent to
Caesar bad cavalry, and employed a slave as a horse hich was
forbidden by the Roman law 3 of having repeated an obnoxious
Greek verse, when he heard that Domitius was shipwrecked and
Caesar besieged ς of having· exulted so much, when this informatiun
was communicated to him, that he intoxicated himself with wine,
and danced naked at an entertainment; and of having· received from
Blesamius, his friend and agentin Rome, letters containing slander-
ous tales concerning· Caesar. We have also learned, that Philippus,
the playsioian and slave, who preferred these accusations, was sub·
orned by Castor, a grandson of DeiotaruS, who was very inimica-Al
to the king, and was induced by rffotives of revenge for some prl-
vate offence to design his grandfather’s ruin. To defeat'the inten-
tion of Castor, and to prove the charges of Philippus false, Cic-ero ¹
pleads with his usual addi-ess and success in the ensuing· oration,
which was delivered in the seven hundred and eighth year of Rome» ἵ
and in· the sixty-second of the orator-'s age.
